pureBitcoin Project
===================

Why another Bitcoin implementation?
-----------------------------------
First of all I want to learn how bitcoin works on the low level. When I have a
look into the bitcoin core code, I get the impression that the structure is
somehow confusing. That's why I'm starting a new implementation from scratch.
Perhaps these efforts will also lead to improvements of the bitcoin core code.

What is the aim of this project?
--------------------------------
The aim of this project is to write a clearly structured implementation of the bitcoin
protocol. Any unnecessary overhead should be avoided.
